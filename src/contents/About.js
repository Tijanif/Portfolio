        <p>
          A self-taught Software Developer with experience in HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, Ruby, and currently learning React and Node.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm constantly learning new things. I love the daily challenges of web
          development: writing quality code, learning new technologies, and
          solving complex problems. Currently those things include gaining more
          experience with React and Node JS.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I'm not learning something new chances are I'm watching football.

        <p>
          I look forward to working on a team that is passionate about their
          product. If you would like to know more about my projects please visit
          my projects page.
